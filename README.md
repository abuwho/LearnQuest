# LearnQuest
Welcome to LearnQuest, an open-source project aimed at creating a comprehensive collection of educational resources for various subjects. This project encourages collaboration and contributions from the community to help make quality education accessible to all.

### Introduction
LearnQuest aims to provide a platform for sharing educational materials, including lecture notes, assignments, and projects. The project's goal is to foster collaboration and knowledge exchange, enabling students and educators to access a wide range of high-quality resources.


### Contributing
Contribute to the project by following some rules: 
- Make changes on a separate branch (*e.g.* `feature/<feature-name>`): 
    ```
    git branch <feature/feature-name>
    ```
    ```
    git checkout <feature/feature-name>
    ```
- Commit and push changes to the remote branch
    ```
    git add .
    ```
    ```
    git commit -m "A very descriptive commit message"
    ```
    ```
    git push origin feature/<feature-name>
    ```
- Open a pull request on the main repository's `main` branch.

### Instructions

- Both backend and frontend should have a `README.md` file in the directory, which include important notes and instructions about that scope of the project and how to run the application.
